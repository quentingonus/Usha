To compile and run sorting_main.c you need to have the 6 files - animal_data.txt, singly_LL_header.h, singly_LL_operations.c, sorting.h, sorting_functions_LL.c and sorting_main.c - in the same folder. The 3 .c files must be passed as command line arguments to gcc.

The sorting functions have additional statements (such as declaration of noIter, noSwap etc.). This is not part of the sorting algorithm. I have included them to understand the number of iterations and swap each of the algorithms take.
